-- 2. FAQ --

Q. Why isn't there a Windows version anymore?
A. I switched to Ubuntu Linux as it's a better development environment, the Windows build will come back when I can build on Mum's computer.

Q. Why is there no Mac version?
A. I don't own one, and I don't know any devs that own one. When we can get a Mac dev, there will be one.

Q. Why is the text so small?
A. It's the default settings for console windows. If you know how, make the text bigger. I can't say much more than that.
