-- 2. FAQ --

Q. Why is there no Mac/Linux version?
A. I don't own one, and I don't know any devs that own one. When we can get a Mac/Linux dev, there will be one.

Q. Why is the text so small?
A. It's the default settings for console windows. If you know how, make the text bigger. I can't say much more than that.
